## What is VERS?

This package is part of the Victorian Electronic Records Strategy (VERS)
software release. For more information about VERS see
[here](https://prov.vic.gov.au/recordkeeping-government/vers).

## What is VERSCommon?

VERSCommon contains common components used by VERS V2 and VERS V3 software.

The two main components of VERSCommon are:
- VERSSupportFiles. This is a directory of support files for VERS V2 and VERS V3.
This includes logging configuration, the VERS V2 DTD, the VERS V3 Schema definitions, the standard VERS V3 VEOReadme.txt file, and the list of valid Long Term Sustainable Formats accepted by VERS.
- src/VERSCommon. These are a set of Java utility classes.

## Using VERSCommon

You can only use VERSCommon with the VERS V2 or V3 software. It needs to
be downloaded and placed in the same directory as the neoVEO (VERS V3) or
V2Check/V2Generator/V2Signer (VERS V2) packages.

Structurally, the package is an Apache Netbeans project.
